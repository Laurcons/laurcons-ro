The biggest pain in the butt was writing the code to create a new database, when needed. In Visual Studio you just click a few buttons and it'll create the database file for you, but I needed to do that programmatically. I tried everything, from creating an empty file and letting SQL Server handle it, from actually talking with SQL Server into making the file, until I screwed everything and just decided to store an empty database template within the program.
