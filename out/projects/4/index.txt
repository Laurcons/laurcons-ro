The hard part is taking every book, writing its book number on it, and then typing its information in the program.

And I also wanted to publish it on my site, but that required additional work, as the program was very error prone. So I undertook the task and I made it to work. The biggest pain in the butt was writing the code to create a new database, when needed. In Visual Studio you just click a few buttons and it'll create the database file for you, but I needed to do that programmatically. I tried everything, from creating an empty file and letting SQL Server handle it, from actually talking with SQL Server into making the file, until I screwed everything and just decided to store an empty database template within the program. As stupid as that might sound, it actually works flawlessly and I ain't changing it."}],"\n",["$","h2","h2-0",{"children":"Features"}],"\n",["$","ul","ul-0",{"children":["\n",["$","li","li-0",{"children":"Ability to have multiple libraries with different books"}],"\n",["$","li","li-1",{"children":"Ability to easily edit stored books"}],"\n",["$","li","li-2",{"children":"Ability to sort and filter the book list"}],"\n",["$","li","li-3",{"children":"Support for large database sizes"}],"\n",["$","li","li-4",{"children":"General support for window resizing (this is hard to code)"}],"\n"]}],"\n",["$","h2","h2-1",{"children":"Known bugs"}],"\n",["$","ul","ul-1",{"children":["\n",["$","li","li-0",{"children":"None... it doesn't do much, but as far as I know it does it flawlessly."}],"\n"]}],"\n",["$","h2","h2-2",{"children":"License"}],"\n",["$","p","p-2",{"children":["This program ",["$","em","em-0",{"children":"is"}]," licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike 4.0 license.
